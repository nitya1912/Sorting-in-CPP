# Title: 
C++ code for implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. 

# Theory:
This C++ code demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple sorting technique. The code defines two functions, bubbleSort and printArray.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Define a bubbleSort function that takes an integer array and its size as input. 2)Use two nested loops to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. 3)Continue the process until the entire array is sorted in ascending order. 4)Define a printArray function to display the elements of an array. 5)In the main function: *Initialize an integer array with unsorted values. *Calculate the size of the array. 6)Call the bubbleSort function to sort the array.
Display the sorted array using the printArray function. 7)The program is now complete, demonstrating the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers in ascending order.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple sorting technique. Here's a summary: 1)It defines two functions: bubbleSort for sorting an integer array in ascending order and printArray for displaying the elements. 2)In the main function: *An integer array is initialized with values. *The bubbleSort function is called to sort the array in ascending order. *The sorted array is printed using the printArray function.

# Title:
 C++ code for implementing the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. 

# Theory:
This C++ code showcases the Selection Sort algorithm, a simple sorting technique. The code defines two functions: `selectionSort` for sorting an integer array and `printArray` for displaying the array's elements. In the `main` function, an integer array is initialized and sorted using the `selectionSort` function. The sorted array is then printed. This code serves as a basic example of sorting an array using the Selection Sort method.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Define a selectionSort function that takes an integer array and its size as input. 2)Use two nested loops to find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array. 3)Swap the minimum element with the first unsorted element. 4)Continue this process until the entire array is sorted. 5)Define a printArray function to display the elements of an array. 6)In the main function: *Initialize an integer array with unsorted values. *Calculate the size of the array. *Call the selectionSort function to sort the array. *Display the sorted array using the printArray function.
7)The program is now complete, demonstrating the Selection Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers in ascending order.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code demonstrates the Selection Sort algorithm, a simple sorting technique. Here's a summary: 1)It defines two functions: *selectionSort sorts an integer array in ascending order by repeatedly selecting the minimum element and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
printArray prints the elements of an array. 2)In the main function: *An integer array is initialized with values. *The selectionSort function is called to sort the array in ascending order. *The sorted array is printed using the printArray function.
